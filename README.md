# DesignPatterns
A Repository for design patterns using C++.

Most of the code I write myself but I do look at tutorials at sites such as
 * https://sourcemaking.com

If some of the code is similiar to what was done in class/another website notify me and I'll change it as soon as possible.

How I plan on learning the patterns is to know the uml diagrams and code examples seperately. I find it's harder to study them together than when they are apart
