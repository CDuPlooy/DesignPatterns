Abstract factory:

Participants:
      Abstract factory: (Creator) Creates a concrete factory.
      Concrete factory: Can produce AProductA or AProductB ; which is to say different classes

      Abstract Products: Should be something like a parent class to the concrete products.
      Concrete Products: Final class of the parent class.

      Client: Uses interfaces defined by the AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct

Imagine adding another layer to the factory method.
