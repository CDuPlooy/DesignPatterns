Gee vir Ancois.

Object inheritance:
     ->Super class/parent class is the upper class that child classes can inherit from.

     ->Animal is a super class.
       Dog and cat are two child classes of the parent class Animal.

     ->A child class inherits everything from the parent class.

     ->A protected member can only be accessed via a child class. (The protected member must be declared in the parent class)

     ->Function overloading:
          help(int a);
          help(char a);

     ->Function overriding:
          Dog::help() is overriding the Animal::help() function.

     ->Virtual functions:
          A child class will rather call it's overridden function.

     ->Pure virtual:
          Cannot implement a pure virtual class.
